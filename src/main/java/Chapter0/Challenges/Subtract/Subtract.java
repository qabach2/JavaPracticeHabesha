     * rather than ints.
     *
     * Doubles represent numbers that may contain decimals. Whether you use an int or double in your projects
     * depends on this use case. (For instance, you count the number of puppies at your pet store with int / whole
     * numbers, but prices are better represented with doubles / decimal numbers.)
