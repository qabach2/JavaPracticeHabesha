What's a variable, and what is its structure?

Java is strongly-typed. This means that we must define what type of variable an object should be before we create one. For example, a variable named 'x' of type int:

```
int x = 0;
```

Java differentiates between primitive types and objects. Primitive types are basic units of information represented by a set amount of bits in a computer. We can think of Objects as custom types that are written by programmers that could themselves contain multiple variables, as well as their own custom behavior which we could execute using methods.

The primitive types in java are:

some for whole numbers:

* byte (whole numbers up to 127)
* short (whole numbers up to 32627)
* int (whole numbers up to about 2 billion)
* long (whole numbers up to about 9 sextillion)

some for decimal numbers:

* float (numbers with decimals that may have slight rounding errors)
* double (numbers with decimals that have smaller rounding errors)

some others:

* boolean (true and false values)
* char (characters)

Strings are NOT primitive types. They are a unique type of Object.
