Java is usually regarded as a compiled language. This means that your code, which is more-or-less readable by a developer, must be converted into another format, which is readable by a computer, but not readable by humans. For Java, this is referred to as machine code. Your IDE handles this step for you every time you run your code, but we could also do it ourselves by using the ``javac yourfile.java`` command in the terminal. This will generate a .class file, which contains the machine code that actually runs.

This is important because you have inevitably already run into a compilation error. A compilation error prevents you from running your code at all, because it means that the java compiler is unable to convert what you've written into a usable state at all. New programmers typically cause compilation errors by having mismatched curly braces, by having incorrect return types, or by attempting to use parameters for methods where the defined parameters don't match.

It's important to write code that always compiles, especially when working on a project. Writing code in small, but functional, increments will help you write and test projects at a reasonable pace, rather than trying to debug a massive project which may accumulate dozens of errors.
