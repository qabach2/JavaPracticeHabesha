# The Debugger
While this text is intended for Intellij users, all IDE's should have some form of built-in debugger or debugger plugin.

Intellij:
You can place red breakpoints by clicking to the right of the line numbers in your code. You can run the debugger by clicking on the 'bug' icon, at the top right of the screen next to the run button. This will activate the debugger window. Your code will now run until it reaches the red breakpoint, which pauses your code and allows you to view the contents of all current active variables. You can click, at the bottom left of the screen and to the left of the debug window, on the green run button with a bar to its left: this is the 'step' button. This will continue running the program until another breakpoint is reached.

I recommend using the debugger on loops. Placing a breakpoint inside of a loop allows you to easily see what happens every time a loop runs.
