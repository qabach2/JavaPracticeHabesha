# Core language knowledge
I find that even people with familiarity with Java (typically from prior classes) don't actually have a very deep understanding of how Java, its APIs, or OOP programming really works, or why we use any of these things. This is why I would like everyone to investigate core-language topics, and I've written puzzles for this to the best of my ability (although it gets really tricky to do so, since Java classes need to be able to compile for me to send this repo to you!)

# Research process

## Search engines
For these problems, research is both encouraged and necessary. A developer need not remember every single factoid she uses to develop software - certainly not Java developers, anyways - rather, a developer is able to conduct research, find information quickly, and be able to justify their decisions based on found knowledge.

How do we conduct research?

Using a search engine is a good start. When you use this, however, you will need to develop a taste for refining which resources you would like to use. Apart from reading your results, you can also get better at making searches:

Quality resources include sites like Baeldung and Programiz. You will no doubt encounter resources of questionable quality as well.

## Documentation

You can also read Java documentation on the web. Java documentation, however, can be a bit difficult for newcomers to read because it often contains lots of information wildly out of scope for what we're trying to do. However, using javadocs to read about String methods or Collections is very powerful, and can teach you unexpected tricks that you wouldn't get from tutorials. It's a good idea to make your own examples or pet projects to test out how an unfamiliar object or method works.

Knowing how to interpret documentation will become particularly useful when we start discussing frameworks like Spring, React, or Angular.

## Intellisense

You may notice that Intellij comes packaged with handy autocomplete and suggested action tooltips. This isn't this end of it, however: if you hold Ctrl on your keyboard and click on a class name or method, you can navigate to that class or method and potentially see Java's own implementation of classes! I recommend trying this with Strings or Collections.

All the best
