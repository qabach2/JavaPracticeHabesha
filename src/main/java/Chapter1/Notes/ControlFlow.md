In order to make our programs useful and interesting, we naturally want their outputs to change depending on their inputs. We generally refer to the internal logic syntax as control flow.

We have:
if/else statements,
while loops,
for loops,
switch (equivalent to if/else),
ternary operations (equivalent to if/else),
do while (a different while loop which will always run at least once)

As the problems we work with increase in complexity, our logic will become increasing nested and intricate.

For loops in particular can be quite tricky, but they will form the basis for much of our logic. For loops are used to run a block of code a set amount of times. Most commonly, they are used with groups of multiple elements, like Arrays and Lists, to 'visit' every element in the group. The code inside of a for loop could be used to write logic to do tasks like search for the maximum value, generate the sum of all the values, etc.
