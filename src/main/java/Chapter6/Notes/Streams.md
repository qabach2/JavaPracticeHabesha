If you've been looking up solutions to some of these coding challenges, you may have encountered solutions that seem to be written in a single line without any loops using Streams. Streams allow us to apply a function to every element in an array or collection individually.

I recommend trying out streams yourself on a few choice problems. Filter Zeroes is a perfect case to look into streams, the .filter method can help you use streams to filter out zeroes.

The lines of code that are contained inside Streams are referred to as lambda expressions, which may come up again during the training. Lambda expressions allow us to pass a code as a parameter to a method.
